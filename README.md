# hello-world
just another repository

Hello Everyone,

I'm Willard (Denny) Clark Im 34 I'm married and have 2 daughters. I like coding this is a great resource to use. Having Github is something that I have been thinking about doing for sometime now so that I can have a repository to put my applications and websites that I have built overtime on.
